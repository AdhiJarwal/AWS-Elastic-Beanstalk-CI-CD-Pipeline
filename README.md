# AWS-Elastic-Beanstalk-CI-CD-Pipeline
Built an automated AWS CI/CD pipeline for web app deployments (CodeCommit, Build, Deploy, Pipeline). Used Elastic Beanstalk with Tomcat for high availability and load balancing. Integrated GitHub (main repo) and CodeCommit (secure Git service) for version control.
